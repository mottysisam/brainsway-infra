## Detailed Implementation Plan & Execution

### Phase 1: CloudWatch Logging Enhancement ✅ COMPLETED

**Objective**: Add individual CloudWatch log groups for each Lambda function in staging and dev environments

**Implementation**:
- Enhanced `infra/live/dev/us-east-2/cloudwatch/terragrunt.hcl`
  - Added dedicated log groups for: sync-clock, generate-presigned-url, presigned-url-s3-upload, software-update-handler, insert-ppu-data, lambda-test-runner, internal-router
  - Set 14-day retention for dev environment
  - Applied consistent tagging

- Enhanced `infra/live/staging/us-east-2/cloudwatch/terragrunt.hcl`
  - Mirror structure of dev environment
  - Set 30-day retention for staging environment
  - Enhanced tagging with environment-specific metadata

**Technical Decisions**:
- Used individual log groups for better observability and cost control
- Environment-specific retention policies (14 days dev, 30 days staging)
- Consistent naming convention: `/aws/lambda/{function-name}`

### Phase 2: Generate Presigned URL Function Repair ✅ COMPLETED

**Objective**: Fix the broken generate-presigned-url Lambda function

**Implementation**:
- Completely rewrote `infra/lambda-functions/generate-presigned-url/src/lambda_function.py`
- Added proper S3 presigned URL generation functionality
- Implemented comprehensive request body parsing for API Gateway events
- Added environment-specific S3 bucket configuration:
  - dev: stsoftwareupdate-dev
  - staging: stsoftwareupdate-staging  
  - prod: stsoftwareupdate
- Enhanced error handling with proper HTTP status codes and CORS headers
- Added support for both upload (put_object) and download (get_object) operations
- Added parameter validation and sanitization

**Technical Decisions**:
- Used boto3 for AWS SDK integration
- Implemented environment interpolation for multi-account support
- Added comprehensive logging and exception handling
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing API contracts

### Phase 3: Repository Organization & Leftovers Management ✅ COMPLETED

**Objective**: Organize deprecated resources and create minimal structure

**Implementation**:
- Created `leftovers/` directory structure:
  - `leftovers/lambda/deprecated-terragrunt-configs/` - Legacy Lambda configs
  - `leftovers/apigw-rest/` - Deprecated API Gateway REST configurations
  - `leftovers/documentation/` - Migration notes and backup files
- Moved legacy resources by environment:
  - Individual Lambda function configs from dev, staging, prod
  - Complete apigw-rest directories organized by environment
  - Migration documentation and backup files

**Technical Decisions**:
- Preserved legacy configurations for potential rollback
- Organized by resource type and environment for easy navigation
- Created comprehensive migration notes documenting changes
- Maintained git history for all moved files

### Phase 4: Naming Convention Standardization ✅ COMPLETED

**Objective**: Remove embedded environment suffixes (-staging, -dev) from resource names

**Implementation**:
- Updated resource naming to use directory structure for environment separation
- Removed hardcoded environment suffixes from Lambda function names
- Standardized to use environment interpolation: `${local.environment}`
- Updated dependency references to use clean naming convention

**Technical Decisions**:
- Environment separation through directory structure vs embedded naming
- Cleaner resource naming improves maintainability
- Consistent with Terragrunt best practices
- Easier cross-environment resource management

### Phase 5: CI/CD Pipeline Fixes ✅ COMPLETED

**Objective**: Resolve CI/CD failures and optimize pipeline performance

**Critical Fixes Implemented**:

1. **CloudWatch Log Group Naming Issue**:
   - **Problem**: API Gateway using `$default` stage name causing invalid CloudWatch log group names
   - **Solution**: Modified `infra/modules/apigw_http_proxy/main.tf` line 99 to sanitize stage names
   - **Change**: `name = "/apigw/${var.api_name}/${replace(var.stage_name, "$", "")}/access"`

2. **Lambda Module Deployment Package Issues**:
   - **Problem**: Missing deployment packages causing terraform validation errors
   - **Solution**: Enhanced Lambda module with dynamic placeholder ZIP creation
   - **Changes**: 
     - Added local provider to `infra/modules/lambda/main.tf`
     - Created runtime placeholder ZIP generation using local_file resource
     - Removed unused source_dir parameters from Lambda configurations

3. **API Gateway Internal Router Dependency Chain**:
   - **Problem**: Broken dependency chain causing null internal_router_lambda_arn
   - **Solution**: Fixed dependency configuration and module outputs
   - **Changes**:
     - Updated staging API Gateway to use main lambda module instead of separate internal-router
     - Added internal_router outputs to lambda module
     - Fixed dependency paths in `infra/live/staging/us-east-2/api-gateway-v2/api-gateway/terragrunt.hcl`

4. **Digger Configuration Optimization**:
   - **Problem**: Overly restrictive locking preventing rapid iteration in dev/staging
   - **Solution**: Environment-specific lock policies
   - **Changes**: 
     - Added `pr_locks: false` for dev/staging environments
     - Maintained `pr_locks: true` for production protection
     - Added `skip_merge_check: true` globally for faster feedback

5. **State Lock Management**:
   - **Problem**: Multiple stuck terraform state locks blocking CI/CD operations
   - **Solution**: Systematic lock clearing and timeout optimization
   - **Actions**: Cleared stuck locks in staging and dev environments using DynamoDB delete operations

### Phase 6: Branch Protection & Status Checks ✅ COMPLETED

**Implementation**:
- Configured main branch protection with required status checks
- Required checks: `pr-check`, `Digger - dev`, `Digger - staging`
- Enabled strict mode requiring branches to be up-to-date before merging
- All CI/CD workflows appear as status checks in PR interface

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Environment Strategy
- **Separation Method**: Directory structure over embedded naming
- **Advantages**: Cleaner resource names, easier management, consistent with Terragrunt patterns
- **Implementation**: `infra/live/{env}/us-east-2/` structure

### Lambda Module Architecture
- **Approach**: Import-first posture with placeholder deployments
- **Rationale**: Allows infrastructure management while preserving deployment flexibility
- **Implementation**: Dynamic placeholder ZIP creation with lifecycle ignore_changes

### Observability Strategy
- **CloudWatch**: Individual log groups per Lambda function
- **Retention**: Environment-specific (14d dev, 30d staging, 90d+ prod)
- **Monitoring**: Function-level metrics and alarms

### CI/CD Pipeline Design
- **Digger Integration**: Environment-specific workflows with parallel execution
- **Lock Strategy**: Flexible dev/staging, strict production controls
- **Status Checks**: Comprehensive validation before merge approval

## Security Considerations

### Secrets Management
- Removed AWS credentials from repository history using git filter-branch
- All sensitive data moved to GitHub repository secrets
- Environment variables properly configured for multi-account access

### IAM & Permissions
- Environment-specific IAM roles maintained
- Cross-account Lambda execution roles configured
- Principle of least privilege applied

### Network Security
- VPC configurations preserved for database connectivity
- Security group settings maintained per environment
- API Gateway authentication configured appropriately

## Performance Optimizations

### Infrastructure Deployment
- Parallel Terragrunt execution where possible
- Optimized dependency chains
- Reduced lock contention through environment-specific policies

### Lambda Functions
- Right-sized memory allocations per function
- Environment-specific timeout configurations
- Efficient packaging and deployment strategies

## Migration & Rollback Strategy

### Backup Approach
- All legacy configurations preserved in `leftovers/` directory
- Git history maintained for all moved resources
- Comprehensive migration documentation created

### Rollback Plan
1. Restore legacy configurations from `leftovers/` directory
2. Revert naming convention changes
3. Restore original Lambda module structure
4. Update CI/CD configurations to previous state

### Testing Strategy
- Progressive deployment: dev → staging → prod
- Comprehensive CI/CD validation at each stage
- Manual verification of critical function endpoints

## Deployment Verification
