# Trigger CI Status Checks

This file exists to trigger fresh CI workflows on the PR head commit to resolve the "waiting for status checks" issue.

**Issue**: Auto-generated commits from GitHub Actions don't trigger new workflows, causing branch protection to wait indefinitely for status checks that will never come.

**Solution**: This manual commit creates a new PR head that will trigger all required status checks.
